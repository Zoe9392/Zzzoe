Asymptotic Analysis:
Run time of operating a program ?
NO actual time to count ---> count the operations ---> scale the runtime ---> order of the growth

Simplification of scaling the runtime:
"cost model" of a program --- focus on only one operation of the program
     highest growth term , and ignore lower terms nad multiplicative constants
     Figure out the order of the growth for the count of representative operation

Big Theta and Big Oh notation:
--- Worst Case: big theta notation

R(N) belongs to Theta(f(N))
k_1f(N) <= R(N) <= k_2*f(N) [a sandwich position]

--- Best Case:
R(N) <= k_2 * f(N)

Big Theta: Order of growth is f(N)
Big Oh: Order of growth is less than or equal to f(N)

O is used as upper bounds of growth function.
