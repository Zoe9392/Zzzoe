Involvement of using Hashing :



Hash Codes: (via Wolfram Alpha) “projects a value from a set with many (or even an infinite number of)
        members to a value from a set with a fixed number of (fewer) members.”

Two Main Challenges in Hashing:
 1. Hashing Collisions
 2. Computing a hash code

 Several Important things:
 Hashing table resizing --- Double the size of bucket when N/M >= 1.5 (N is the number of items and M is
                                                    the number of buckets)
 [
    it is in terms of runtime analysis to optimize the current hashing table: Theta(Q) to Theta(1) which
 is a constant;

    separate chaining in hash table with/without resizing
