Key Concepts and Developments:
The current problems? (when building large problems/projects ; the enemy is complexity)
The COMPLEXITY[IMPORTANT for large projects]
Tools for managing the complexity ?
 ---> Hierarchical abstraction
    Creat layers of abstraction with clear abstraction barriers

 ---> "Design for changes"
    Organize problems around projects; HIDE INFORMATION others don't need; Objects decide how things are done

Modules and Encapsulation
Module: A set of methods that work together as a whole to perform some task or set of related tasks.
    A module is said to be ENCAPSULATED if its implementation is COMPLETELY HIDDEN, and it can be accessed only
  through a documented interface. E.g.: cell

Abstraction Barriers:
(Proj1B: Encapsulation, great for java)
Note the keywords: private, static, concerned with inheritance

Implementation inheritance Breaks Encapsulation:
example: Dog and Verbose Dog

Type checking and Casting
Compile-Time Types and Expressions
