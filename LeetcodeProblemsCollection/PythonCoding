"""
Name: Jump Game  No.55 Level: Medium 

You are given an integer array nums. 
You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each 
element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

Examples:
Input: [2,4,2,0,1], [2,0,0], [0,1,0], [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: True, True, False, False

# Attempt 1:  use recursions 
#   ---> Maximum Recursion Limit or Time Limit Exceeds 
#   ---> MAXIMUM JUMP LENGTH doesn't mean the EXACT length of jumping 
# Attempt 2: while-loop + indicators via brute force 
#   ---> indicators taken: currVal:nums[i] & currSum: currSum-=nums[i]
#   ---> weakness: too many edge cases can not be covered  
# CHANGE WAY OF THINKING (Start at the back side):
# IDEAS: (from solution board)
# Attempt 3: If I started at index 0, searching for next available spots.
#   ---> nested for-loops should be BANNED or SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED
#   ---> Accepted! Results are not optimal
#   ---> (i): current spot is FALSE at lst, you can not Jump. For example:
#   --->   the current spot is 0 and the 0 can't be skipped 
#   ---> (ii): AVOID O(N^2) time consumption by mutating the last element
#   ---> in lst to be FALSE if you can jump to the end of the nums at the step
#   ---> (iii): the first spot at lst will always be TRUE 
#   ---> (iv):  
# Attempt 4: It is EXTREMELY HARD to solve in this way starting at index 0. 
#   --->  Starts with the goal
